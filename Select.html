        <li>The game starts with a deck of cards shuffled between two players.</li>
        <li>Each player draws a card from the top of their deck, and the player with the higher card takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck. If the cards are tied, the players draw again until one player has a higher card.</li>
        <li>The game continues until one player has all the cards in their deck, and that player is declared the winner.</li>
        <li>If both cards that are played are the same then both players must put three cards in a discard pile and play another card</li>
        <li>Whoever has the higher card will win everything in the discard pile.</li>
